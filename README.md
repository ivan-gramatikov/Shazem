# Shazem


For ROOT users, this is going to be really painless. 

Just use a root file explorer, go to `Data/Data/` and look for one or more folders with `shazam` in their name. Then, what you may want to do is look for `library.db`. This is where shazam usually stores its databases. These storages hold the list of your songs...

For NON-ROOT users, you will have to use ADB to backup the entire app 

`TODO: add a tutorial on how to backup the entire app so as to get THE DATABASE out of the backup...`


What you may want to do is to copy this and put it in the folder where you cloned/downloaded my python script and run it. 
It will put the songs in a list. You can use it to automate further... For copyright concerns, I have decided to only hint a possible usage but not implement it fully, it is up to you to figure out how to go on from there.. with a list of songs..
